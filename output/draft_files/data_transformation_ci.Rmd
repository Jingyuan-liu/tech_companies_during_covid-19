## Data Transformation 

For confidence index data,  there is a csv file on the website which is free to download. We can easily use ‘read.csv’  function in R to read in the data.  Drop the ‘standard error’ columns, and rename two ‘ index values’ columns to differentiate between institutional category and individual category. Moreover, the 'Date' column needs to be formatted in a way that corresponds with other two data source.  

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/tech_companies_during_covid-19")
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

CI <- read.csv("data/CI.csv")
ci <-CI %>%
  select("Date","US.Institutional.Index.Value","US.Individual.Index.Value")%>%
  drop_na()
```
