+ Project summary: 
In this project, we have picked the 5 most representative types of tech companies including Streaming, Ecommerce, Entertainment (Gaming), Videoconferencing, and integrated tech companies. We evaluated the companies’ performances mainly based on three measurements: stock closing price, quarterly revenue, and investors' Confidence Index. First, we look at the companies’ behave on the stock market. Moreover, we introduced the Confidence Index to evaluate investor confidence in the market. Finally, we also take the companies’ quarterly revenue into account. Based on the three measurements described above, we hope our work would provide some insight for those who look back at this unprecedented year.
